# Score Four

This is the world's worst [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) clone and my first attempt at a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`. It is also my first time using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

- Singleplayer games are played against a simulated opponent
- Multiplayer games are turn-based, played on the same device.

**Board size**

Select a size (default 7x6):

## How to Play

Play is turn-based. Red goes first, followed by yellow, and so on. Connect, err, score four chips horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win.
